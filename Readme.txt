This project is developed in Python by Jivisha Gaur and Paarth Jha.

This is a solution of the famous Travelling Salesman Problem using Greedy approach, displayed with a GUI using PyGame module.

To start, open the tsp.py file. Change the value of the variable 'number_of_points' to any integer, which denotes the number of cities, and just run the code. The red colored line will be the shortest path, with its length being shown at the bottom. The line and its length will change as the algorithm finds a shorter path than the previous.

If you encounter an error saying "OpenSans-Light.ttf not found" or related, copy the font file provided in the zip to C:/Users/[USERNAME] and run the code again.
